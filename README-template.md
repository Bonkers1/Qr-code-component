## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

I learned to get better at using html and css, projects like these help me get used to css and html in general.

### Continued development

I couldn't think of anything here that I wanted to improve for now but just doing html and css related topics helps either way.
